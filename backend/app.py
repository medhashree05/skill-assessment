## TASK â€“ 90-Day Roadmap Only  

âœ… **STRICTLY output ONLY a 3-phase roadmap** (no ROI narrative, no extra sections).  
âœ… **Make it feel like a website-style career roadmap** â†’ clean, simple, motivational.  
âœ… **Be extremely personalized**: Mention the user's domain, role, and specific skill gaps.  
âœ… **Use bullet points, short sentences, and practical weekly steps.**  
âœ… **Include measurable progress milestones.**  

---

### **OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)**

90-DAY PERSONALIZED ROADMAP

### PHASE 1 (0â€“30 Days) â€“ [Motivational Title]
- **Focus Areas:** [Specific weak categories & why (personalized)]
- **Weekly Actions:**
  - Week 1: [Specific step]
  - Week 2: [Step]
  - Week 3: [...]
  - Week 4: [...]
- **Milestone by Day 30:** [Score target or tangible skill achievement]

### PHASE 2 (31â€“60 Days) â€“ [Motivational Title]
- **Focus Areas:** [Moderate skill clusters, why they matter for career goal]
- **Weekly Actions:**
  - Week 5: [...]
  - Week 6: [...]
  - Week 7: [...]
  - Week 8: [...]
- **Milestone by Day 60:** [Clear achievement]

### PHASE 3 (61â€“90 Days) â€“ [Motivational Title]
- **Focus Areas:** [Strong categories â†’ leadership & visibility, very role-specific]
- **Weekly Actions:**
  - Week 9: [...]
  - Week 10: [...]
  - Week 11: [...]
  - Week 12: [...]
- **Milestone by Day 90:** [E.g., "Score crosses 75%+, ready for mid-level role"]

---

## STYLE RULES
- Be **personal, encouraging, and clear** (like talking directly to the user).
- Avoid paragraphs â€“ keep it **structured and scannable**.
- **DO NOT** generate generic career roadmaps found online â€“ strictly use **this user's data**.
- No extra ROI text, no reporting metrics â€“ **ONLY the roadmap**.
